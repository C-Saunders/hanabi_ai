##Status of Master

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/akaps/hanabi_ai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/akaps/hanabi_ai)

## Getting Started

To run the example simulation
```
sample.sh
```
To get help info for running your own simulations
```
python 'playgame.py -h
```

### Variants

Hanabi has 3 variants to increase difficulty, included in the rules sheet. They are:

1 - Adds the multicolor suit as a 6th suit to the game. It is not a wildcard suit

2 - Same as Variant 1, but only 1 card from each rank of the multicolor suit is used

3 - Adds the 6th suit to the game and these cards are wild. In this variant, you cannot call out the mutlicolor suit. Instead, the multicolor cards always count as the color in your clue. When playing the card, it counts and builds as the 6th color
